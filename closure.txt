DESCRIPTION

When we declare a new function inside an aleady declared function this is known as closure.
The new function remembers the environment in which it was created,
i.e. it remembers the variables and parameters of function whose it is part.
Whenever we call this new function it has access to its own variables as well as varibales and
 parameters of the outer function, also it has access to global variables
